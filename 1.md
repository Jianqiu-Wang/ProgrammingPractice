Given two numbers represented by two different arrays A and B. The task is to find the sum array. The sum array is an array representation of addition of two input arrays.  
Input: 
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M separated by a space denoting the size of A and B respectively. The second line of each test case contains N elements and next line contains M elements.  
Output: 
Output the sum array.  
Constraints: 
1 ≤ T ≤ 100 
1 ≤ N ≤ M ≤ 106 
0 ≤ Ai, Bi≤ 9
